**Virtual Gravity Theory (VGT) — Volume II

Quantum Corrections and Structural Expansion**

Volume II develops the second stage of the Virtual Gravity Theory (VGT),
extending the foundation established in Volume I (Chapters I–IV).

This volume introduces the quantum correction framework acting on the

 and the emergent gravitational structure.

Derivation of the quantum self-energy term, renormalized amplitude

Formal definition of the operator acting on the metric

its covariance properties, and resulting corrections to curvature.

Chapter VII — Physical Interpretation & Low-Energy Limit

Connection between the operator framework and physically measurable
quantities without committing to numerical cosmology.

Chapter VIII — Structural Links to Observables

Mapping of the quantum-corrected gravitational structure to
observationally relevant constructs — still theoretical and non-numerical.

Purpose of Volume II

The goal of Volume II is to:

Provide a complete quantum correction framework for VGT

Establish a fully covariant definition of the correction operator

Prepare the theoretical basis for Volume III (emergent potentials)

Ensure compatibility with Volume I and future volumes

Volume II remains pure-theory only and does not rely on observational
datasets or numerical cosmology.
