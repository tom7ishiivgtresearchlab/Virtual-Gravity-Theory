# Virtual Gravity Theory (VGT) — Volume I / Chapter IV

**Current Version:** ver1 (2025-11-24)

## Overview

This chapter demonstrates **autonomous completion** of Virtual Gravity Theory through self-consistent running coupling dynamics. We prove that all physical constraints—positivity (Im Π ≥ 0), causality (v_g ≤ c), and renormalization group stability—are satisfied without ad hoc assumptions.

Two explicit UV completion scenarios are presented: (i) U(1)_EM × U(1)_X gauge mixing with heavy fermions (Hypothesis A), and (ii) pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone boson framework (Hypothesis B). Both demonstrate the framework's self-consistency, where the theory determines its own structure through internal consistency requirements rather than external constraints.

Theoretical predictions from the running coupling dynamics match observational forecasts from VGT III with precision ΔG/G < 0.05%, establishing μ(z) = ξ × H(z) from first principles.

## Key Results

1. **Positivity from Optical Theorem**: Im Π ≥ 0 emerges automatically from unitarity
2. **Automatic Causality**: v_g ≤ c preserved everywhere via Kramers-Kronig relations
3. **RG Stability**: Gaussian (Hyp A) and Free (Hyp B) fixed points ensure IR stability
4. **Observational Precision**: Theory matches VGT III forecasts with < 0.05% error
