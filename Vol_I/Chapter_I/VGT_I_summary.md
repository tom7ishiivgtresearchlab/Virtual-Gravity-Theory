# VGT I: Empirical Foundations — Summary

**Current Version:** ver5 (2025-11-24)

## Overview

Virtual Gravity Theory I (VGT I) establishes the first empirical constraint on the time variation of Newton's gravitational constant *G* using cosmic chronometers. This work tests whether *G* has remained constant over the past 11 billion years of cosmic history, providing observational foundations for testing gravitational theories at cosmological scales.

## Main Results

Using 44 high-precision *H(z)* measurements from cosmic chronometers spanning redshifts 0 < *z* < 2, rigorous Bayesian analysis with Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods yields:

- **ξ = -0.00015 ± 0.00686** (68% confidence interval)
- **|ΔG/G₀| < 1.5%** at *z* = 2 (95% confidence interval)

These constraints demonstrate that *G* has remained constant within 1.5% precision over the past 11 billion years, fully consistent with Einstein's General Relativity while providing independent validation of the equivalence principle at cosmological scales.

## Methodology

The analysis employs model-independent cosmic chronometer data—direct measurements of *H(z)* that do not rely on distance ladders or assumptions about spatial geometry. The VGT parametrization G(z) = G₀[1 + ξ ln(1+z)] provides a simple, testable modification to GR, with ξ = 0 corresponding to constant *G*.

Statistical methods include:
- Maximum likelihood estimation for best-fit parameters
- MCMC sampling (450,000 samples) to map posterior distributions
- Comprehensive convergence diagnostics
- Model comparison via Akaike Information Criterion

## Significance

This work establishes empirical groundwork for understanding gravitational phenomena at cosmological scales. The analysis validates the consistency of current observational data with constant *G*, while the VGT parametrization provides clear falsifiable predictions for future high-precision surveys including DESI, Euclid, JWST, and LSST.

The results demonstrate that current cosmological observations are consistent with General Relativity, while future percent-level measurements will provide definitive tests of gravitational theories.
