# 🌌 Virtual Gravity Theory (VGT) — Volume I (Chapters I–IV)

This repository contains the foundational results of **Virtual Gravity Theory (VGT)**,  
focusing on **Volume I (Chapters I–IV)** — the theoretical core on which all later volumes will be built.

---

## 📘 Overview of Volume I (Ch I–IV)

Volume I establishes the basic structure and mathematical foundations of VGT.

### **Key Contributions**
- **Introduction of the root field Ψ₀**  
  A scalar field that stabilizes gravitational interactions across scales.
- **Natural incorporation of quantum corrections**  
  Links quantum effects smoothly with general relativity.
- **Running gravitational coupling**  
  A scale-dependent description of gravitational strength.
- **Quantum origin of the cosmological term Λ**  
  Λ arises dynamically rather than as a fixed constant.
- **Foundation for autonomous completion**  
  Provides the necessary structure for self-consistent closure of VGT.

These chapters define the mathematical core that supports all higher-volume developments  
(black holes, Dyson–Schwinger effects, UV completion, and quantum gravity Vol.II–V).

## 🔍 Purpose of This Repository

This repository provides:

- A transparent record of theoretical development  
- Public documentation for scientific discussion  
- Version-controlled progress prior to peer-reviewed publication  
- A permanent home for future volumes (Vol.I–V)

If you use or reference VGT, please cite appropriately (CITATION.cff will be added soon).
