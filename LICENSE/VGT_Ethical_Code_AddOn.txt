VGT Ethical Code Add-On
Applies in addition to the main CC BY 4.0 license.

The following ethical principles govern the use, distribution,  
and modification of materials related to Virtual Gravity Theory (VGT):

1. Honesty and Transparency  
   Users must not misrepresent the theory, its predictions,  
   or the author’s views.

2. Scientific Integrity  
   Modifications or derivative works must clearly state:
   - What was changed
   - Who made the changes
   - Whether the results are speculative or unverified

3. Responsible Use  
   VGT materials must not be used for:
   - Political propaganda
   - Market manipulation
   - Misinformation
   - Any purpose that endangers public safety

4. Academic Freedom  
   Criticism, replication attempts, and theoretical extensions  
   are welcome, provided they maintain professional integrity  
   and proper attribution.

5. Attribution  
   Any redistribution or modification of VGT materials  
   must clearly attribute the original work to:
   “Tsutomu Ishii — Virtual Gravity Theory (VGT), 2025.”

6. Preservation of Original Intent  
   The core theoretical structure of VGT must not be represented as  
   the author’s work if heavily modified or repurposed.

This document is an ethical extension and does not override  
the freedoms of the CC BY 4.0 license;  
it defines expected scientific conduct when working with VGT.
